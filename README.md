# Image-Processing-OCR

===========================

## Convolution Nueral Networks ##
This project is based on CNN for optical character recognition to achieve more accuracy to predict text data or images from a trained model.
Convolutional neural network (CNN) has been proposed for generic image SR as well as text image SR

## Technologies used ##

 - MATLAB
